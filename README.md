# LinearRegression
# What I Did
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset (removed missing/null values).

2. Visualized the data using scatter plots.

3. Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. Trained a simple linear regression model.

5. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R² Score.

6. Plotted the regression line to show prediction vs actual values.

# What I Learned
i. Basics of Linear Regression

ii. How to fit a regression model using sklearn.linear_model

iii. Interpretation of evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)

iv. Importance of preprocessing and data visualization
